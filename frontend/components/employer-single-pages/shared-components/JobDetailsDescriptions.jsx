      <p>
        Moody’s Corporation, often referred to as Moody’s, is an American
        business and financial services company. It is the holding company for
        Moody’s Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and

        Moody’s was founded by John Moody in 1909 to produce manuals of
        statistics related to stocks and bonds and bond ratings. Moody’s was
        acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 1962. In 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun off
        Moody’s Corporation as a separate company that was listed on the NYSE
        under MCO. In 2007, Moody’s Corporation was split into two operating
        divisions, Moody’s Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody’s
        Analytics, with all of its other products.
